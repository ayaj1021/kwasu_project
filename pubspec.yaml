  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/logo/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: segoeui
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-ExtraBold.ttf
  #         weight: 800                                                  
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-SemiBold.ttf
  #         weight: 600
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-Medium.ttf
  #         weight: 500
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-Regular.ttf
  #         weight: 400
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-Light.ttf
  #         weight: 300
  #       - asset: assets/font/segoeui-Thin.ttf
  #         weight: 200
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
